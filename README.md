# Shadow-Generation-based-on-Shadow-Volume
This project implements real-time shadow generation using the Shadow Volume technique in OpenGL. The method generates shadows by creating geometric volumes that represent shadowed spaces in a 3D environment, providing pixel-perfect shadow boundaries without common resolution-dependent artifacts.
